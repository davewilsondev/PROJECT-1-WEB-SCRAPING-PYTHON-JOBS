# PROJECT-1-WEB-SCRAPING-PYTHON-JOBS
Project where I web scrape a popular jobs board and see what accompanying skills are most sort after along with python. 

Project Steps

- Search indeed.co.uk for Python jobs in the last 7 days.
- Search through each job for specific key words. Need to create a list of the specific key words.
- Populate a table/database with the results.
- Try and visualise the results some how. What insights can I get from this?
- Try and visualise a trend. 
- Make this easy to reuse with different job searches. 

***

I plan on using beautiful soup to do my web scraping so going to do a few tutorials on this to start off with. 
Is there a API for Indeed?
I will need to populate a table or database so will have to learn some stuff about this. 
To visualise I could potentially use matplotlib. 
What tools will I need to create?
